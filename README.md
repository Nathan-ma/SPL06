# SPL06-007
Ardino SPL06-007 Library

This is a work in progress to create a working Arduino library for the SPL06-007 pressure sensor. I am able to get the coefficents, pressure, and temperature readings from the sensor, but the pressure reading is inaccurate. The datasheet seems unclear on how you are modify the pressure calculation based on the selected oversampling.
